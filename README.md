# Imgflip API Assignment

Let's continue working with APIs and work with another API (Imgflip API). Imgflip is a meme (image) generator.

## Getting Started

### Imgflip API

You can find the Imgflip API documentation [here](https://imgflip.com/api).

You don't need an API key (like GIPHY), but requests can get throttled if used too much.

We will review the API in class.

## Application Behavior

- The app will pull a default meme image from the API.
- The meme image will have text from both input fields displayed at the top and bottom.
- When the user updates the text and clicks the button, a random meme image will be rendered.

That's it. ðŸ˜Š
